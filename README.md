# Hello, Everyone! Greetings from me, Aenno!

This Mandala art that is in this repository is somewhat based off on the Philippine Flag. <br/>
Seeing that the colors that are found in this code is of the same with our Flag. <br/>
I have chosen to use a black background so that the colors would be given emphasis <br/>
because this is the highlight of my work. With a black background, the colors of the Mandala Art <br/>
is somewhat vibrant and can be seen well. My design is mostly composed of square-patterns with a flower on the middle. <br/>
